# Covid Vaccination Date Helper

Live at https://seifelg.github.io/daysago

This is something I made to help with my work at the Covid vaccination centre.

The page calculates the date eight weeks ago, which is the minimum gap between first and second doses, as well as 180 days ago, which is the minimum gap between the second dose and the booster dose.

Currently uses Babel in-browser to compile JSX to JavaScript. This is slow and not ideal.
